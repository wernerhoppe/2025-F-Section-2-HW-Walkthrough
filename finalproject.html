    <h1 class="top box1">My Experience with PACS Healthcare</h1>

    <div class="center">In <span style="font-weight: bold;">2023</span>, I decided I wanted to work for <a href="https://pacs.com/" target="_blank" title="PACS Official Website">PACS</a> as a <span style="font-weight: bold;">skilled-nursing home administrator</span>.</div>

    <div class="textwidth">It all started when my aunt invited me to shadow her boss at a company called Ensign.
    After seeing how much of a positive impact I can make people
    and seeing how the career perfectly blends my passions for business and healthcare,
    I decided this was where I was going to make my mark.</div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

    <p class="textwidth">Since then, I developed a relationship with not only the amazing recruiters at PACS, but also
    countless current and incoming administrators and regionals.</p>

    <p class="textwidth">I've been lucky enough to land an internship in the San Diego Region for the summer of 2026.</p>
    <div class="textwidth">I owe all the glory to God. He's the one who got me here. I rely wholly on Him!<br><br>
